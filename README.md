# audioEmotionPrediction

Human emotions help communicate the inner feelings of every being and most often itâ€™s easily done through speech, through semantics and voice attributes, such as pitch, loudness, etc. Human beings have innate ability to recognize these emotions expressed in speech, but this task is not easy for machines, yet! This project aims to build a simple neural network solution to try and predicting some basic human emotions given audio speech data.
